# About This API

Each site can provide txt files on his base domain, allowing crawlers to get additional information about the site.

For example: 
* [www.example.com/robots.txt](www.wa-site-builder-5f0de58e-dc43-4b7c-a616-d55f5ea434c7.org/robots.txt)
* [www.example.com/ads.txt](www.wa-site-builder-5f0de58e-dc43-4b7c-a616-d55f5ea434c7.org/ads.txt?petri_ovr=specs.EnableAdsReader:B)

Using this API you can update and get:
1. robots.txt file - tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.
2. ads.txt file - ensure that your digital ad inventory is only sold through sellers (such as AdSense) who you've identified as authorized.
