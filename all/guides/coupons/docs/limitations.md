# Coupon Functionality

- Price discounts for collections apply to every item in that collection, no matter the item's price. If the coupon sets a $10 discount and there is an $8 item in that collection, that item will be free when a customer applies the coupon code.
- Only 1 coupon can be applied per order. (It is, however, possible to offer free shipping above a set price along with another coupon.)
- Coupon codes are case and space sensitive. (We recommend instructing customers to copy and paste the coupon code without making any changes.)
- All discounts require a coupon.
- Limit to 1 discount per order: If a customer buys multiple items that the coupon applies to, the discount is applied to the item with the lowest price.
- Limited number of uses: You can set a limit for the number of times the coupon can be used in total, but you can't limit the number of times a specific customer can use the coupon.
- If you or the Wix site owner created a coupon for a product, and then deletes that product, there is no notification that this product has a coupon attached to it.
- Buy X Get Y:  
   - Applies only to products in the userâ€™s cart (e.g., to apply a buy 3 get 1 free coupon, the customer must add 4 of the relevant product(s) to their cart.  
   - The defined scope for the coupon applies both to the product purchased and the product received for free (e.g., buy 3 of product X, the 4th is free, or buy 3 products from collection X, get the 4th for free).
- Coupons can't be limited to a specific type/subset of customers (e.g., first-time or returning customers, customers from specific locales, etc.).
- Coupons are not available for quantity based discounts in Wix Stores (e.g., if you buy 10 shirts, you get a 10% discount on the total price). However, you can add a quantity product option with a negative charge.
- Gift card features are not available at this time.
- There is no bulk upload capability for coupons.
- Coupon currency can't be defined per coupon - $ discount coupons will be applied in any currency that the Wix site owner has set up in their Wix Business Manager settings.
- Coupons for bookings scopes can't be applied to membership plans, or to services that are set to "Free/Prices Vary".
